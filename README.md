# Bioinformatics Learning Materials

Welcome to the Bioinformatics 101 (Learning Materials) repository! If you're someone with a background in biology and cell signaling and are interested in diving into the world of bioinformatics, you're in the right place.

## About

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, and data analysis techniques to interpret biological data. It encompasses various topics such as sequence analysis, genome assembly, gene expression analysis, protein structure prediction, and more. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore the basics or an experienced practitioner seeking advanced resources, you'll find something valuable here. I'll mostly assume that you are someone with some experience and familiarity with biology and cell signaling, and you understand the biological principles underlying many bioinformatics applications.
